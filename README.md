# Voter Registration Trends Dashboard

This application was built to visualize voter registration trends over time in Oregon. With the permission of my former employer, Our Oregon, I am making the code publicly available. This application is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, which you can find in this repository in a file named license.txt. The data is from the office of the Oregon Secretary of State. My hope is that someone might find this useful, to use with another state's data, as an example of a Shiny app, or whatever. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
